# A-hybrid-deep-learning-model-based-on-LSTM-Long-Short-Term-Memory-networks-for-Anti-Money-Laundering
This project involves experimenting a hybrid deep learning model to detect money laundering patterns in a transaction dataset by IBM synthetic data generator. The hybridisation involves combining layers of Convolution Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks (Recurrent Neural Network).
