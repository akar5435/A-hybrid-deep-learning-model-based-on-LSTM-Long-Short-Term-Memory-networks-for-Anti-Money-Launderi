# Money-laundering-patterns-detection-in-an-IBM-transaction-dataset
This project involves experimenting a hybrid deep learning model to detect money laundering patterns in a transaction dataset by IBM synthetic data generator. The hybridisation involves combining layers of Convolution Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks (Recurrent Neural Network).
